# DocuLaw AI - Project Specification

## Executive Summary

DocuLaw AI is a legal document translation and comprehension platform designed to bridge the gap between complex legal language and public understanding. The platform aims to democratize access to legal information, particularly benefiting low-income and minority communities who cannot afford expensive legal consultation.

## Problem Statement

Most people have limited literacy in legal documents and public policy, disproportionately affecting low-income and minority groups who don't have the financial resources to afford expensive lawyers and paralegals. This creates a significant barrier to understanding legal rights, obligations, and available protections under the law.

## Project Goals

### Core Objectives

1. **Document Translation & Simplification**
   - Translate complex legal documents into easy-to-understand language
   - Maintain legal accuracy while improving accessibility
   - Provide contextual explanations for legal terminology

2. **Intelligent Legal Research**
   - For confusing topics, suggest relevant documents, laws, and legal precedents
   - Create connections between related legal concepts
   - Provide comprehensive context for better understanding

3. **Interactive Legal Assistant**
   - Implement chatbot functionality for users to ask specific questions
   - Provide real-time responses to legal queries
   - Enable natural language interaction with legal information

### Stretch Goals

1. **Multilingual Support**
   - Translation features for Spanish, Chinese, and other languages
   - Specifically target victims of immigration bias
   - Culturally sensitive legal explanations

2. **Public Policy Expansion**
   - Extend beyond legal documents to general public policy
   - Government regulation explanations
   - Policy impact analysis for communities

## Data Flow

1. **Document Ingestion**
   - User uploads legal document through React frontend
   - Document is processed and chunked for analysis
   - Groq LLM analyzes document content and structure
   - Document embeddings stored in Pinecone

2. **Translation Process**
   - Groq LLM generates simplified version of legal text
   - System identifies complex legal terms and concepts
   - Related documents and explanations retrieved from Pinecone
   - Simplified version presented to user with contextual links

3. **Interactive Query**
   - User submits question through chat interface
   - Query processed by Groq LLM for intent recognition
   - Relevant information retrieved from Pinecone vector database
   - Comprehensive response generated and delivered in real-time
